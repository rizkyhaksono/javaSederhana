# Java Sederhana

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Java Sederhana in action.**

This is a minimal application based on the [javaSederhana](https://github.com/rizkyhaksono/javaSederhana) within the Java documentation.

A basic Casual Java application needs just these files:

- `Main.java` - Starts the app and creates a program to your command prompt
- `Intellij Idea` - To write a code or any of text *(You can use any of IDEs)*

You can learn more about each of these components within the [javaDocs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) (which comes with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)) installed on your computer. From your command line:
